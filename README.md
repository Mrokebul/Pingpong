This code will compare the Ping result (latency, packet loss) of four ISPs (which are connected with 4 diffrent SSIDs) to multiple destinations(apple, gmail, facebook etc.).

[STEPS 1 AND 2 ARE FOR THE FIRST TIME USE ONLY]


Make sure you have done the followings:

1. Downloaded the latest python installer from here:

	https://www.python.org/downloads/

	https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.4/python-3.6.4.exe

*****N.B: while installing python, please install it in the directory where you can recall later.

2. install the library openpyxl
	
	* As you have installed the python environment at your desired directory, you should 
	  know where to find it.
	
	* Go to the directory and find the folder: Scripts
	
	* inside the folder you should see pip.exe file
	
	* copy the location.
	  Example--->  C:\Users\Support\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\Scripts
	
	* open CMD
	
	* put below commands:

	 cd C:\Users\Support\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36-32\Scripts
	 pip install openpyxl

	After successful completion of above steps, your PC will be pinging for the foreseeable future. :)
